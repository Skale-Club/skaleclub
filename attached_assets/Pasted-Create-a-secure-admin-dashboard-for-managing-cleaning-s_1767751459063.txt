Create a secure admin dashboard for managing cleaning service categories and products.

AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS:
- Implement secure authentication using Supabase Auth
- Create one admin user with email: [SEU_EMAIL]
- Protected routes - redirect to login if not authenticated
- Admin access only at route: /admin
- Logout functionality

DATABASE STRUCTURE (Supabase):
Create these tables with proper relationships:

1. categories
   - id (uuid, primary key)
   - name (text)
   - description (text, optional)
   - order (integer)
   - created_at (timestamp)

2. services
   - id (uuid, primary key)
   - category_id (uuid, foreign key to categories)
   - title (text)
   - description (text)
   - price (decimal)
   - duration_hours (integer)
   - duration_minutes (integer)
   - image_url (text)
   - is_active (boolean, default true)
   - created_at (timestamp)

ADMIN DASHBOARD FEATURES:

Category Management:
- List all categories with service count
- Add new category
- Edit category name and description
- Delete category (with warning if contains services)
- Reorder categories (drag-and-drop or up/down buttons)

Service/Product Management:
- Filter services by category
- Search services by name
- Add new service to a category
- Edit service details:
  * Upload/replace image (store in Supabase Storage)
  * Title
  * Description (textarea)
  * Price (USD, formatted as currency)
  * Duration (separate hours and minutes fields)
  * Active/Inactive toggle
- Delete service (with confirmation)
- Bulk actions (activate/deactivate multiple)

UI/UX REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, modern design using Tailwind CSS or shadcn/ui
- Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
- Loading states for all async operations
- Success/error toast notifications
- Form validation with clear error messages
- Confirmation modals for destructive actions
- Empty states with helpful CTAs
- Image preview before upload

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use React with TypeScript
- Supabase for database and storage
- Proper error handling
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- Image optimization (resize/compress before upload)
- Row-level security (RLS) policies in Supabase

SUPABASE SETUP:
- Provide SQL migration script for tables
- Configure Storage bucket for service images
- Set up RLS policies for admin-only access
- Create the admin user in Supabase Auth

DO NOT BUILD:
- Customer-facing interface
- Booking system
- Payment processing
- Public pages

Start with authentication setup, then database structure, then admin interface.
