You are a senior WordPress, WooCommerce, and booking-system architect.

Your task is to design and guide the implementation of a complete online booking website for a cleaning company using:
- WordPress
- WooCommerce
- WooCommerce Bookings
- Elementor
- Crocoblock (JetEngine, JetElements, JetWooBuilder, JetFormBuilder)

The goal is to create a scalable, service-based booking system where customers can select multiple cleaning services, see the total price and total estimated duration, and schedule everything in a single visit.

========================
1. SERVICE TAXONOMY & STRUCTURE
========================

Organize all cleaning services using WooCommerce product categories and subcategories (hierarchical taxonomies).  
This structure must be clean, intuitive for customers, and scalable for future services.

Main Categories:

1) Upholstery Cleaning
   Subcategories:
   - Sofas (2-seater, 3-seater, sectional, L-shaped, etc.)
   - Mattresses (Twin, Full, Queen, King)
   - Chairs & Armchairs
   - Other Upholstered Items (ottomans, car seats, etc.)

2) Carpet & Rug Cleaning
   Subcategories:
   - Residential Carpets (by room or fixed area size)
   - Area Rugs (small, medium, large)
   - Commercial Carpets (optional / future-ready)

Each subcategory must contain the related service products.
The structure must allow adding new main categories in the future (e.g. House Cleaning, Window Cleaning) without breaking the system.

========================
2. SERVICE PRODUCTS (WOOCOMMERCE)
========================

Each cleaning service must be created as an individual WooCommerce product.

For each service:
- Use a clear name (e.g. "3-Seater Sofa Cleaning")
- Add a short and clear description of what is included
- Assign it to the correct category and subcategory
- Use a fixed price (simple product pricing model)

Important rules:
- Each service is a standalone product
- No dynamic pricing
- No complex variations unless strictly necessary
- If sizes differ, create separate products (preferred)

========================
3. BOOKING CONFIGURATION (WOOCOMMERCE BOOKINGS)
========================

Each service product must be converted into a Bookable Product.

Booking rules:
- Fixed duration per service (e.g. 2 hours for a sofa)
- Duration is defined individually per product
- Services block time on the calendar based on their duration
- Optional buffer time between bookings (for travel/prep)

Availability:
- Define working days and hours (e.g. Mon–Sat, 8am–6pm)
- Prevent same-day bookings if needed
- Allow only valid booking windows

Resource Management:
- Create a single shared resource called "Cleaning Team"
- Resource quantity = 1
- Assign this resource to ALL services
- This prevents overlapping bookings and enforces sequential scheduling

========================
4. MULTIPLE SERVICES IN ONE VISIT
========================

The system must allow customers to:
- Add multiple service products to the cart
- Combine them into one single visit
- Have all services performed consecutively by the same team

Key requirement:
- Only ONE date and ONE start time should be selected
- The total duration is the SUM of all selected services
- The booking system must block the entire time window accordingly

========================
5. FRONT-END SERVICE DISPLAY
========================

Create a clear and user-friendly service selection flow.

Service Entry Page:
- Display main categories as visual cards (image + title + CTA)
- Example: "Upholstery Cleaning", "Carpet Cleaning"

Service Listing Pages:
- Display services in a grid:
  - Image
  - Service name
  - Price
  - Estimated duration
  - "Add to Cart" button
- Allow adding services directly from the listing (no need to open product page)

Use Elementor + Crocoblock dynamic listings to build this.

Optional:
- Product pages can still exist for details
- Clearly instruct users:
  "Select all services first. Schedule your appointment in the next step."

========================
6. CART: PRICE & TOTAL DURATION
========================

The cart must act as a quick estimate summary.

Cart requirements:
- Show all selected services
- Show individual prices
- Show individual durations (optional)
- Display:
  - Total price
  - Total estimated duration (sum of all services)

Example:
"Total estimated service time: 3 hours 30 minutes"

Duration can be retrieved from:
- WooCommerce Bookings duration
OR
- A custom meta field (minutes) per product

This information must be visible before checkout.

========================
7. CHECKOUT & SINGLE BOOKING FLOW
========================

At checkout, the customer must:

1) Choose ONE date and ONE start time
   - Applies to the entire cart
   - Total duration determines the end time automatically
   - Time slot availability must respect existing bookings

2) Enter essential customer information:
   - Name
   - Phone
   - Email
   - Service address (labeled clearly as "Service Address")

Checkout must be simplified:
- Remove unnecessary fields
- Rename billing fields if needed for clarity

========================
8. PAYMENT OPTIONS
========================

Enable two payment methods:
- Pay Now (online payment)
- Pay on Site (pay at the time of service)

Rename payment-on-delivery to something clear like:
"Pay at Service Location"

Both methods must confirm the booking.

========================
9. CONFIRMATION & BACK-END VISIBILITY
========================

After checkout:
- A WooCommerce order is created
- One combined booking blocks the correct time range
- Admin can view bookings in WooCommerce Bookings dashboard
- Customer receives confirmation email
- Admin receives notification

========================
10. FINAL REQUIREMENTS
========================

- The system must be scalable
- No hardcoded logic that prevents adding services
- Booking conflicts must be impossible
- UX must be clear and intuitive
- The system must work without requiring custom coding for daily operation

Deliver:
- Architecture decisions
- Recommended plugin configurations
- Suggested UX flow
- Any necessary custom logic explained clearly (even if optional)

Do NOT:
- Explain basic WordPress installation
- Suggest unnecessary plugins
- Overcomplicate pricing or booking logic

Focus on structure, flow, and correctness.
